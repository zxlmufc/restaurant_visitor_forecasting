# Objective:
The challenge of this competition is to predict the potential business value of a person who has performed a specific activity. 

# Data set:
- People file
The people file contains all of the unique people (and the corresponding characteristics) that have performed activities over time. Each row in the people file represents a unique person. Each person has a unique people_id.

- Activity file
The activity file contains all of the unique activities (and the corresponding activity characteristics) that each person has performed over time. Each row in the activity file represents a unique activity performed by a person on a certain date. Each activity has a unique activity_id.
The activity file contains several different categories of activities. Type 1 activities are different from type 2-7 activities because there are more known characteristics associated with type 1 activities (nine in total) than type 2-7 activities (which have only one associated characteristic).

# Submission:
